# Issues

## Creating issues

If you find a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/blotoutio/website/issues). Learn how to search by the title, body or comments [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/blotoutio/website/issues/new).

### Label guidelines for creating issues

Every issue needs to have a `category` and `type` label, and always assign an issue to someone. Feel free to add links, notes, references, etc. as comments on the issue. `@` someone in the comments to loop them in by notifying without assigning the issue to them.

#### Category labels (required)

If work on that issue would begin in a design tool or word processor, label it `design / copy`. If work would begin in a code editor, label it `dev / tooling`. For something (that you’re sure is) extremely important, use `major`

#### Type labels (required)

There are three that are self-explanatory – `bug / fix`, `enhancement / feature` and `type: new page` . Another one new page should be used for completely new pages.

#### Other labels

- There are four priority levels – `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`. Just try and be mindful with this label and talk to the assignee when in doubt.
- Use the remaining labels – `closed / duplicate`, `closed / invalid` , `closed / maybe later` , `closed / stale` , `closed / wontfix` and `on hold` – as needed

## Solving issues

Scan through the [existing issues](https://github.com/blotoutio/website/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using **labels** as filters.

**Tip** – When looking for issues that need to be worked on now/soon, look for warmer colours like the reds and yellow.
