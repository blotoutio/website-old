### Facebook CAPI Advanced Matching lift for every growth engine!

#### Improve your Facebook event scores by 30% via EdgeTag Facebook CAPI, and get 25% ROI on your Facebook spend overnight.

Last December, we had announced the availability of a serverless tag system, eventually to replace Google Tag Manager, focused on the delivery of serverless Facebook CAPI pixels. The launch was exclusive with Cloudflare and the response was overwhelmingly positive.

We worked with half a dozen customers, some small, and some large (>20M pixel events a day) and the results were overwhelmingly positive (validated by Facebook Event scores).

Today, we are announcing the launch for any customer using Facebook as a marketing channel with the launch of EdgeTag CDN, focused on sales and marketing activation signals, after a massive success with the first set of customers using Cloudflare.

With this service any Facebook advertiser can now avail services to send a FB Serverless Conversion API (CAPI) using Javascript (like the client pixel) that has magic built in to automate advanced matching that drives ROI;

1. Better Facebook event scores (see below) – 40-50% improvement.
2. About 30% better ROI on your Facebook spend.

And YES, even if you have Facebook CAPI via your Shopify engine or any other provider, EdgeTag will improve 30% scores for Facebook Advanced Matching above those implementations by taking advanced matching to another level.

## European Compliance laws, both Privacy Shield & GDPR, are built-in

Blotout EdgeTag CDN will be zoned in Europe (Privacy Shield compliant), and does not process any data for a non consented user (GDPR compliant). Rest assured you can avail to the services and drive significant ROI without the complexities of Cloud and Server GTM.
