In today’s digital world, data has become increasingly important for businesses of all sizes. As such, investing in a data asset is no longer a luxury or reserved for large enterprise companies, but a necessity for nearly all companies.

However, the cost associated with data management and collection can be a major barrier to entry for many businesses. Fortunately, there are low cost and free solutions available on the market that offer a cost-effective alternative to the traditional Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) tools like Google Analytics 4, Segment, and Amplitude.

## The Challenge with SaaS

SaaS solutions can be great for quick data collection and analysis, but they come with certain disadvantages. SaaS tools are limited in terms of the amount of data that can be collected and analyzed. They also require companies to transfer data to or from third-party providers, leaving them vulnerable to potential security breaches. Additionally, most SaaS solutions are not designed to capture granular customer data, which can be an important asset for companies looking to better understand their customers and drive revenue. We’ve seen the obsoletion of 3rd party cookies enter the market and begin to take full effect, leaving marketing and sales teams without access to the same level of granular data they have become accustomed to in prior years with traditional performance marketing practices.

## What is first-party data?

First-party data is data that is collected directly from customers by the business. This type of data provides businesses with access to valuable insights into their customers, such as purchase behavior, preferences, and loyalty. In turn, first-party data is essential for driving successful marketing and sales efforts going into the future. First-party data can bring with it a variety of benefits, such as improved customer experience, increased revenue growth, competitive advantages, and tax advantages.

## Why does this matter to me?

First-party data provides businesses with the ability to collect and analyze more granular customer data than traditional SaaS solutions, as well as greater control over data security. Moreover, first-party data assets can provide tax advantages for businesses, as the owner has shifted from the SaaS providers to the business that uses them.

One of the primary benefits of investing in a first-party data asset is the potential to take advantage of certain tax savings. Investment in a data asset can potentially be accounted for like any other appreciating and depreciating asset class. Thus, taking it as a non-recoverable expense and moving it to investment further increases the value of a company while providing additional tax advantage potential. Additionally, businesses may also be able to take advantage of certain tax credits for investing in a first-party data asset solution. These incentives could further reduce the costs associated with managing and collecting data in an otherwise already costly tech stack most companies manage.

## Other key advantages of first-party data assets

Beyond the potential tax advantages, investing in a first-party data asset can also be beneficial for businesses in other ways. By utilizing Blotout's Edgetag solutions, businesses will have access to the most accurate and up-to-date data possible. This information is sent to a company's existing channels and technology stack to minimize disruption and legal complaint concerns. With more accurate and updated data, marketing and sales teams can be better informed, allowing businesses to make smarter decisions that lead to increased profits. Additionally, Blotout's solutions are user-friendly, meaning businesses can spend less time setting up and managing the data asset and more time utilizing it for business insights.

By investing in a first-party data asset, businesses can have greater control over their data. By storing and managing the data themselves, they will be able to ensure their customers' information is securely stored and accessed only when necessary. This level of security and control can provide peace of mind for customers, business owners, and legal teams alike.

## The innovators, imitators, and losers of first-party data

Many solutions claim to have first-party data and magic pixels that restore marketing performance and fix compliance issues. Upon further investigation into these solutions, most are built on the same principles as SaaS tools with 3rd party cookies. The key difference is many use something called proxy servering or beaconing, a method that masks a 3rd party solution to appear on the surface as a 1st party data collector. This serves as a great imitation of a short-term solution to a complex problem, but long term, these solutions are unable to provide the same data accuracy and insights, as a true first-party solution controlled solely by the business that deploys them.

## What next?

Investing in a first-party data asset can be an intimidating prospect, but there are many advantages that make it worthwhile. Not only can businesses benefit from potential tax savings, but they can also have greater control over their data and gain more accurate insights into customer behavior.
