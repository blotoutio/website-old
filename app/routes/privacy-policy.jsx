              personal information, and the right to delete your information.
              You may exercise all of these rights as described in the “Your
              Rights and Choices” section. Blotout does not sell your personal
              information, as defined under CCPA, and has not done so for the
              past 12 months.
            </p>

            <p>
              You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an
              authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your
              rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an
              agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have
              authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify
              your identity directly with us. To provide or delete specific
              pieces of personal information we will need to verify your
              identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We may
              require additional information to verify your request.
